# AR-Drawing

# Purpose:

Mini app to test Apple new AR Kit framework (augmented reality). The app provides the user the ability to draw shape and text in 3D and places them in the user's direct environment using the user's device camera. The drawn shapes are anchored to real worl anchor-points and therefore remain fixed in space, as the user moves closers and or goes around them. Even if the drawn shape go outside of the phone's focus, the drawn shape re-appear at the right place when the user turn back towards them. 

# Key learnings:

- Learned how to leverage Apple's new AR Kit to develop dynamic augmented reality experience
- Learn basic Core Graphic library to draw elements on a user screen.
- Learn to use plane detection and anchor points to "fix" drawn shapes in place to offer a convincing Augmented Reality experience
